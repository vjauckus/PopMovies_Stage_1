# PopMovies_Stage_1

Project for the Udactity Android Developer Nanodegree (https://www.udacity.com) by Google.

To run the app you need an api key. You can create one here: The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

Save the key as API_KEY_VALUE in NetworkUtils.java file (https://github.com/vjauckus/PopMovies_Stage_1/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/veronika/android/popmovies/NetworkUtils.java).

App is currently under development. Maybe it will not run / compile.
