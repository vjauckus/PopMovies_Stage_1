Project for the Udactity Android Developer Nanodegree (https://www.udacity.com) by Google.

This is the first stage of Popular Movies project with additional functionality. The app allows users

- to fetch movie data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
- change the sort order via settings: popular or by highst-rated.
- to see detailes of movie: original title, a plot synopsis, user rating.
 
Maintaining state even after rotation.
 
Internet is required for first launch of the application and when the filter type is changed

To run the app you need an api key. You can create one here: The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

Save the key as API_KEY_VALUE in NetworkUtils.java file (https://github.com/vjauckus/PopMovies_Stage_1/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/veronika/android/popmovies/NetworkUtils.java).
